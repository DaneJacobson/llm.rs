# llm.rs

This repo is a svelte implementation of Andrej Karpathy's [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/tree/master) in Rust. The goal of this project was to internalize the basics of transformer math, regrok C, and learn Rust. So far as that was the goal, this project was successful and I highly recommend it for anyone getting into AI fundamentals or programming in general.

Everything runs on the CPU. CUDA may be added later but solely to reduce latency and/or learn CUDA.
