# llm.rs

This repo is a svelte implementation of Andrej Karpathy's [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/tree/master) in Rust. The goal of this project was to internalize the basics of transformer math, regrok C, and learn Rust. So far as that was the goal, this project accomplishes that and I highly recommend it for anyone getting into AI.

Everything runs on the CPU. I later may add CUDA but solely for the latency benefit.
